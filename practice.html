<p>As a novice web designer, you’re building your portfolio and looking for ways to attract clients and opportunities. You need web design project ideas that will help you (and other novice web designers) get the practical knowledge you need to make responsive and user-friendly websites and web applications.<br>

    Developing project ideas should not only help you become a better web designer, but they should also help you become a better programmer. After all, your work is more than website design — you’re also helping brands create apps and online tools that improve the customer experience.</p><br>
